#Image Labeling Tool

I am building an image labeling tool. Users can use this tool to generate their datasets for object detection tasks. 

It is written in Python. And I used PyQt for the interface design.

Example interface:

- [x] Draw the basic interface (menu bar, )
- [x] Open an image and display it
- [x] Make the opened image automatically fit the window size
- [ ] Create resizable movable bounding boxes
